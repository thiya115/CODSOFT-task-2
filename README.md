This project focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing transaction data, performing exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, and applying classification algorithms to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions. The project emphasizes feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable fraud detection. The ultimate goal is to develop a robust model capable of detecting fraudulent activities effectively, enhancing financial security.
